1. Setup folders
    1.1. Make sure you are in the workspaceFolder (can't miss it)
    1.2. Create "app" folder to store the application main file
    1.3. Create "code" folder to store the implementation files (.h/.hpp/.c/.cpp)
        1.3.1. Add as many subfolders as the project requires
    1.4. Create "build" folder to store files generated by CMake
    1.5. Folders can be created manually or with command -> "mkdir filename"

2. Create CMakeLists.txt files
    2.1. Create one in workspacefolder (mandatory)
    2.2. Create one in each subfolder of your project (app, code ...)
    2.3. Follow the commands for CMakeLists.txt files

3. Build and execute your project
    3.1. Command -> "cd build" (enter build folder)
    3.2. Command -> "cmake .." (setup CMake files for build)
        3.2.1. From the bottom bar of VS Code press the button that asks to select a kit (for compiler)
        3.2.2. If the compiler is not detected try to restart VS Code
    3.3. Command -> "cmake --build ." (actual build)
    3.4. Command -> "./ProjectExecutable" ( or any other name you choose for cmake
                                            command "add_executable" to run the program)
