# CustomSTL

Personal approach inspired from MSVC STL. Actual code is found in "code/stl" folder.

Compilation requirements:

- C++20 version
- GCC (Linux or Windows) or MSVC (!no thread support!)

Components not fully operational:

- Memory.h (Shared/Weak)
- Algorithm.h
- Complex.h
- ForwardList.h operations (splice/sort/merge)
- BasicStringView
