# CustomSTL

Personal approach inspired from MSVC STL. Actual implementation is found in "code/stl" folder.

Compilation requirements:

- C++20 version
- GCC (Linux or Windows) or MSVC (!no thread support!)

Components not fully operational:

- c_memory.h (Shared/Weak)
- c_algorithm.h
- c_forward_list.h operations (splice/sort/merge)
